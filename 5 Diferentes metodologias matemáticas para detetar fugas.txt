In this research, we present five different methodologies to
detect leaks in water distributions system based on an
extended horizon analysis of pressure sensitivities. The first
method, called Sensitiviy Matrix Binarization, is based on the
transformation of real-valued sensitivities matrix to a binary
matrix, according to a threshold. The second is the
Correlation method, the third and fourth are the Euclidean
distance and the Angle between vectors methods; the last
method is the Least square Optimization method. The five
methodologies were tested in simulation with two different
water distribution systems named Hanoi and Quebra.
